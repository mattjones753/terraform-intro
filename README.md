Terraform Intro Demo
==============

This project contains some simple terraform code to show some of the simple features of terraform managing AWS infrastructure in a single account.
To see a overview of all the steps and the final code, see the master branch.

Step 1
----

This is the most basic terraform code I could think of.
It creates a basic S3 bucket in the current AWS account when you run `terraform apply`.
At this stage, there's nothing in it, but you should be able to see it in the AWS console.
