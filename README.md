Terraform Intro Demo
==============

This project contains some simple terraform code to show some of the simple features of terraform managing AWS infrastructure in a single account.
To see a overview of all the steps and the final code, see the master branch.

Step 5
----
This step enables us to SSH into the instance. You'll need an SSH Key pair to do this. To create one, run the following:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "username@example.com" -f tf_rsa -N ''
```

The terraform code expects a file in the current directory called `tf_rsa.pub`, which should be created by the above command.

You will be able to SSH onto the instance by looking at the `instance_ip` variable for the IP address and using the private key generated by the above command like this:

```bash
ssh -i tf_rsa ubuntu@<instance_ip>
```

replacing <instance_ip> with the actual IP address
